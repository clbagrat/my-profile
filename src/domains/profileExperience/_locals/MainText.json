{"text":"My name is Bagrat. And I really hope you took previous line seriously. I’m a frontend developer. I enjoy creating systems and solutions for complex problems. But this isn’t a LinkedIn page, this is my safe space. Here I’ll try to form my vision.",
"text1": "The tech still excites me, but over the time I started to look for something more than another frontend framework or development pattern. I want to use my tech skills as a tool for crafting pieces that could be classified as art. Something that one can FEEL. I'll try to explain this.",
"text2": "While at work I spend my time creating efficient solutions where I’m min-maxing every aspect of a problem, in my personal life I’m more in favour of “form over function” approach.  I’m ready to sacrifice some functionality if it’ll make final form simpler. While having something simple usually is about sacrificing something, I’m not a masochist, I just don’t afraid of limitations. I think limitation sparks creativity. I like my keyboards to have less buttons than usual (e.g. I don’t have arrow keys), so I had to be creative and come up with my own shortcuts for such keyboards, now I don’t move my elbows when typing. Being simple doesn’t always mean to be primitive. Opposite. Simple things can solve the biggest part of a problem. And usually it requires complex solution “under the hood” to support the simplicity. I spent a lot of time creating an Animation component that requires 0 configuration. It’s very simple on surface but very complex behind the curtains. VIM is well aligned with my vision too, very simple cli tool that is preinstalled almost everywhere but still so powerful and complex behind the curtains. It limits you in comparing to full blown IDE, but also “unlocks” you. This isn’t a minimalism by any mean. I would say I just like disproportion of simplicity and the way this simplicity achieved. Think of Malevich square. Yes, this is how I end up going after art via tech, nobody expect any function from art, so it can look as simple as I want, but most of the people won’t find immediate answer on how this is implemented. This is the fastest way for me to express myself. Take this this page, this is the simplicity I’m talking about. Page has only black and white colors. But it sparked my creativity and I had to use those colors in unusual way. It limits you as a user, this forces you to think outside of the box. It makes you think and imagine how hard is to implement such animation. Let me tell you, this is quite hard, but to make it performant is even more challenging. You already seen fps reports in console, doesn’t look too bad, right? I went full throttle on optimization and precisely calculated illusion to make this simple thing work. I find this page to be in a perfect balance of functionality, simplicity and effort behind it. I really enjoyed crafting it. Because I strive for simplicity and it doesn’t matter how complex it is."
